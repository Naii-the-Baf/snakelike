# Snakelike
A dynamic, multiplayer Snake game. Multiple AIs with differing movement sets compete in a board for survival.

A Snake game made with diversity in mind; i.e. it's easy to add new Snake and Snake AIs to the game.

Currently, the following values are in snakelike.cfg:

map_height, map_width - The dimensions of the map.

players - Amount of players.

draw_delay - Delay in ms for drawing.

player_delay - Delay in ms for player actions.

initial_size - Initial size of players.

item_density - How dense should items be. The higher this value, the less items appear.

food_growth - How much collecting food increases size.

haste_length - How many player movements should haste and slow be active for.

X_amount - The amount in game of a particular movement type (i.e. Snake type).

ai_X_amount - The amount in game of a particular AI.
